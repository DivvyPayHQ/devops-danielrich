# Scripting Exercise

 Write a script which pulls from the Star Wars API and reports a list of starships and ALL pilots. Which language you use, how it is done and the rest are up to you. The exercise constraints:
 * The script should run from the centos7 docker image.
 * It reports output to stdout in a readable manner (a list of starships and ALL pilots)
 * Use the repository we created for you, and push your script(s) and Dockerfile to it
 * Your end result should be something we can run, so please include instructions for running it that a smart engineer who might not be familiar with your tech stack could follow.
 * Email us when you are done.
 * Only submit your own work. You can use libraries and frameworks, but make sure you wrote the script itself.
 * The project is deliberately open-ended because we want to see how you build it--there is not any preferred way to get to the end result.
